### Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important to get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
